# Basic usage of print ()
print("Hello, world")
print("Welcome to python programming.")
# Using print() with variables
name = "Ola"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
# Using f-strings with print()
name = "Ayo"
score = 95
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")
# Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ade"
last_name = "Martins"
print("Full name:" + first_name +" " + last_name)
# Comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "world!")       # With comma
print("Hello" +" " + "world!")   # with concatenation
